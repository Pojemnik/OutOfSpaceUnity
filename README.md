# Out of space Unity edition

The goal of this project is to learn Unity by remaking an old game made by me and my friend using C++ and SFML library.

The game won't be exactly the same as the old version. I will try to improve it a bit and add more levels, enemies and other stuff.

Credits available in game or in Assets/misc/credits.txt.

### The game can be played here:
