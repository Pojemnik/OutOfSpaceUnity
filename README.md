# Out of space Unity edition

The goal of this project is to learn Unity by porting an old game made by me and my friend using C++ and SFML library.

After porting all of the features of original version, I will try to improve the game a bit by adding more levels, sounds etc.

Most of the assets have been taken from opengameart.org. More specific credits are in original project.
